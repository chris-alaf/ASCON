Thesis - Architecture Development `and FPGA Implementations of the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithm ASCON
This thesis presents the effects of the unroll and pipeline techniques on Ascon. All designs implement the three functions of the suite on the same circuit. The starting architecture labeled U1 and in short uses one permutation unit, muxes and XOR gates to implement all operations (fully folded design) executing one permutation round per clock cycle. By increasing the unrolling factor (2,3,6) more rounds are executed per cycle and while the area increases so does the throughput. Ascon's structure offers many pipeline possibilites. Here we test the use of outer pipeline between the four stages so they can operate in parallel. Instead of one permutation unit there are now four, one for each stage. The increase of permutations and registers leads to substansial more hardware usage but again offers much more speed. Lastly, we combine the two techniques by apllying unrolling to each pipeline stage to achieve maximum speed. Note that each design is implementetd using two different variations of the s-box (d1 and d2) to observe their impact across the board. The results show that d2 is the clear winner showing better all round metrics. The unrolling results come second only to those of the creators while we are the first to use pipeline on the suite so there is no comparing.
